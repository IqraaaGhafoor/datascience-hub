# Day 7/100 and Day 8/100: Data Science Challenge! 🚀  
**Data Science Methodology 🧠📊**

Welcome to Day 7 and Day 8 of my 100-day data science challenge! 🎉  
Today and yesterday, I focused on **Modeling**, **Evaluation**, **Deployment**, and **Feedback**—key stages of the data science process.

## **Resources for Day 7 and 8** 📚

Here are the key resources I used today and yesterday to understand the concepts:

- [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)
- [Data Science Methodology by IBM on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology) – A thorough course by IBM diving into data science methodology.

### **Day 7: Modeling and Evaluation**

#### **1. Modeling**
- **What is it?**  
  The process of creating models to understand or predict outcomes.
- **Example**:  
  Think of it like **cooking a new dish**:  
  - **Descriptive Models**: It’s like figuring out a flavor profile. For example, if you add ingredient A, it’ll likely pair well with ingredient B.  
  - **Predictive Models**: It’s like predicting if a new combo of spices will work. You’re testing if a specific recipe (model) will succeed based on past experiences (data).
- **Purpose**: To uncover patterns or make predictions from the data (just like tweaking a recipe to make it perfect).

#### **2. Evaluation**
- **What is it?**  
  Checking if your model is working as expected and improving it.
- **Example**:  
  After baking your cake (model), you **taste-test** it. If it’s too sweet or too dry, you adjust the recipe.  
  In data science, this means running your model on a test set and tweaking it based on the results (like fixing the flavor of your cake).
- **How it’s Done**:  
  Use tools like **accuracy rates** or **ROC curves** 📈 to check how well your model is performing. Think of the ROC curve as a scorecard for how accurately your model identifies the right outcomes (yes/no).

### **Day 8: Deployment and Feedback**

#### **1. Deployment**
- **What is it?**  
  Putting the model into use in real life.
- **Example**:  
  After perfecting your cake, you start selling it at your bakery 🍰. Now it’s out in the world, and people are experiencing it.
- **Process**:  
  Stakeholders (like the bakery team) start using it. This could involve testing the model on real data (like using the cake recipe with actual customers), adjusting as needed.

#### **2. Feedback**
- **What is it?**  
  Gathering feedback from users to improve the model.
- **Example**:  
  Imagine your bakery customers give feedback on your cake—maybe it’s too sweet or not sweet enough. Based on this feedback, you improve the recipe for the next batch.  
  In data science, the model is adjusted over time using feedback from the real world, ensuring it stays relevant and effective.
- **Process**:  
  After deployment, the model is revisited and refined based on real-world results (like customer feedback at your bakery).

### **CRISP-DM Model (Data Mining)**

The **CRISP-DM** method helps guide the data mining process step-by-step. Here’s a breakdown of the 6 stages:

1. **Business Understanding**: Know the problem you're solving. Like understanding the customer's need for a specific cake flavor before you start baking.
2. **Data Understanding**: Gather the data you need (think of it as collecting fresh ingredients for your recipe).
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and organize the data (prepare your ingredients so they’re ready to go into the recipe).
4. **Modeling**: Create the model (bake your cake). You select the right method for analyzing the data and adjust it if needed.
5. **Evaluation**: Test the model (taste-test your cake to see if it's the perfect recipe). Make adjustments if the model doesn’t work well.
6. **Deployment**: Put the model into use (serve your cake to customers). Use it in real situations to make decisions.
7. **Feedback**: Refine the model based on real-world performance (customer reviews) to make sure it stays useful.

### **Conclusion**

Over these two days, I’ve learned how critical it is to not only build models but also ensure they perform well and are ready to be used in real-world applications. **Modeling** allows us to create the frameworks for understanding and predicting, while **Evaluation** helps us ensure those models are effective. Then, **Deployment** takes the model to real-world scenarios, and **Feedback** keeps it refined, making it even better with every iteration. The entire process is iterative and dynamic, ensuring the data model stays aligned with real-world needs.

Excited to see how these foundations will shape future projects! 🔍🚀
