# 100-Day Data Science Challenge

Welcome to my **100-day data science challenge**! This directory is where I’m documenting my journey through the world of data science. Each day, I’ll dive into new challenges, explore exciting concepts, and experiment with tools to help me grow as a data scientist.

## Purpose of the Challenge 🎯
The main goals of this challenge are:
- **Deepen my understanding** of data science concepts.
- **Apply hands-on practices** and tools to solve real-world problems.
- **Track my progress** and reflect on what I learn every day.
- **Share insights, resources, and solutions** that could help others on their data science journey.

## What to Expect 🔍
Here’s what I’ll be doing every day:
- **Learning**: I’ll dive into different topics, from basics to advanced (machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization etc).
- **Experimenting**: I’ll apply the knowledge I gain by working on real-world problems and projects.
- **Reflecting**: I’ll share my experiences, challenges, and the solutions I come up with.

Each day is an opportunity to explore new areas in data science and build my skills.

## Progress Tracking 📈
I’ll be updating this directory daily with what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and the tools I’ve used. You can follow along with my journey, see how I improve, and track my growth as I continue to learn.
